A moderate perception check spots over a dozen (3d4 +9) ice mephits sleeping in the snow. The party can attempt a skill challenge to avoid the mephits. On a failure, the mephits attack (groups of 4 in initiative, half of them arrive in the second round). On a success, the party makes it through the maze of mephits.

mo¿na coœ dopisaæ involves them slow-running through the current environment in nothing but a loincloth while being attacked by this bird dealing 1d4 psychic damage in the process. The player may make a Wis saving throw DC14 after each attack to wake up. Once they wake up, a dark figure falls from the tree in a fury of sounds, beak, and claws as it attacks the player. The creature looks like a bird, but almost humanoid and definitely cursed in some evil twisted way (use kenku stats). Once the player defeats the creature, they will truly wake up in a cold sweat as the dream slowly fades from memory.

If the party rolls high enough though, she will reveal that what she sells is the only thing she can make, potions of imagination. She developed a method to incorporate a magical potential in a liquid that is released with consumption, the effects are based on what the target believes it is similar to a placebo, for anyone without an expectation will drink colored water. The magic is not perfect though, and she can only create minor potions.";rare;Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp
